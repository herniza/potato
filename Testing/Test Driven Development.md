# TDD Mantra
> TDD Cycle : Red > Green > Refactor > Red > Green > etc
1. Red (Test fails): since we write test first before write the implementation, the test means to be failed at first

2. Green (Test passes): write the minimum implementation to make the test pass

3. Refactor: times to do cleaning, makes the code better without changing the behavior
